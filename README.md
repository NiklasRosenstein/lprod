# lprod

A parallel L-System producer written in C++17. Maybe at some point also
a visualizer.

__Goals__

* Learn something about [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
* Play with C++ threads and synchronization primitives to implement a function
  for parallel batch transformations (see `parallel.hpp`)
* Try a different C++ coding style (ie. curly braces of higher order
  constructs on the next line)
